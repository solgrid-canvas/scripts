## 🔄 NEW: Enhanced Resume with Missing Pixel Recovery

**Never lose progress or have incomplete images again!** The embedder now automatically saves your progress and can intelligently recover any pixels that failed to place.

### 🛡️ Bulletproof Features:

- **💾 Auto-Save**: Progress saved every 10 pixels automatically
- **🔄 Smart Resume**: Continue with automatic missing pixel detection
- **🔧 Missing Pixel Recovery**: Finds and places pixels that failed due to network errors
- **📊 Session Tracking**: Each embedding session gets a unique ID
- **⏰ Smart Expiry**: Sessions auto-expire after 24 hours
- **🎯 100% Completion**: Guarantees your image is always complete

### 🔧 How Missing Pixel Recovery Works:

1. **Saves Complete Image**: Stores the full original pixel list for validation
2. **Network Error Handling**: When pixels fail (timeouts, disconnects), they're skipped but remembered
3. **Smart Resume**: When resuming, validates the entire image against the server
4. **Missing Pixel Detection**: Finds pixels that should be there but aren't
5. **Automatic Recovery**: Places all missing pixels to ensure 100% completion

### 🔄 Enhanced Resume Commands:

```javascript
// Check if you have a saved session
checkSession()

// Resume with intelligent missing pixel recovery
resumeEmbedding()
// Now offers two modes:
// 1. Continue with remaining pixels only
// 2. Validate & recover missing pixels (RECOMMENDED)

// Manual validation anytime
validateImage()

// Clear saved progress (start fresh)
clearSession()
```

### 📱 How the New Resume Works:

1. **Start embedding normally** with any embed command
2. **If something goes wrong** (browser crash, refresh, network errors):
   ```javascript
   initEmbedder()  // You'll see: "🔄 Found incomplete session..."
   resumeEmbedding()  // Choose validation mode for 100% completion!
   ```
3. **Intelligent Recovery** - Checks entire image for missing pixels
4. **Zero incomplete images** - Every image is guaranteed complete

### 💡 Enhanced Resume Example:

```javascript
// After network errors caused 200 pixels to fail:
initEmbedder()
// "🔄 Found incomplete session from 12/4/2024, 3:45:23 PM"
// "📊 Progress: 800 placed, 200 remaining"

resumeEmbedding()
// Choose option 2: "Validate & recover missing pixels"
// System finds that 150 pixels from earlier actually failed
// Automatically adds them back to queue
// Final result: 100% complete image!
```

### 🔍 Manual Validation:

```javascript
// Check completed images for missing pixels
validateImage()
// "🔧 Found 23 missing pixels that need to be placed"
// Option to place just the missing ones
```

## 🎯 Understanding the Canvas

The SolGrid canvas is **1000 pixels wide** by **1000 pixels tall**. Think of it like a grid:

```
(0,0) ─────────────────────── (1000,0)
  │                              │
  │         TOP AREA             │
  │      (good for headers)      │
  │                              │
  │  LEFT    CENTER    RIGHT     │
  │  AREA     AREA     AREA      │
  │(quieter)(crowded!)(quieter)  │
  │                              │
  │       BOTTOM AREA            │
  │    (good for signatures)     │
  │                              │
(0,1000) ─────────────────── (1000,1000)
```

### 📍 Good Locations to Try:

| Location | Coordinates | Why It's Good |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Top Left** | `(50, 50, 100)` | Less crowded, visible |
| **Top Right** | `(750, 50, 100)` | Less crowded, visible |
| **Left Side** | `(100, 400, 80)` | Moderate traffic |
| **Right Side** | `(700, 400, 80)` | Moderate traffic |
| **Bottom Left** | `(100, 750, 100)` | Good for signatures |
| **Bottom Right** | `(700, 750, 100)` | Good for signatures |
| **Center** | `(400, 400, 120)` | ⚠️ Very crowded! |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Open Chrome/Firefox Console - Paste the embedder.js code

### Step 1: Initialize
```javascript
initEmbedder()
```
*This sets up the script and detects your account tier (and any resumable sessions with missing pixel recovery!)*

### Step 2: Check for Resumable Sessions
```javascript
checkSession()  // Optional: see if you have incomplete work
```

### Step 3: Choose Your Location
Pick one of these commands based on where you want your image:

#### 🎯 **For New Areas (Credit Saving)**
```javascript
embedImage(x, y, size)  // Skips pixels that are already correct
```

#### 🔥 **For Canvas Wars (Territory Claims)**  
```javascript
embedImageFast(x, y, size)  // Overwrites EVERYTHING - claim your territory!
```

**Examples:**
```javascript
// Peaceful placement (saves credits)
embedImage(50, 50, 100)    

// AGGRESSIVE TAKEOVER (costs more credits but dominates area)
embedImageFast(750, 50, 80)   
```

#### 🏠 **Center (Warning: Crowded!)**
```javascript
embedAtCenter(120)  // Places at (400, 400) - expect conflicts!
```

---

## 📏 Choosing the Right Size

The `size` parameter is the **maximum width/height** of your image in pixels:

- **30-60px**: Small icons, logos, signatures
- **60-120px**: Medium artwork, detailed images  
- **120-200px**: Large artwork (takes longer, uses more credits)

**💡 Tip:** Start small (60px) to test, then go bigger if you like the result!

---

## 🎨 Step-by-Step Example

Let's place a 100px image in the top-right area:

1. **Initialize:**
   ```javascript
   initEmbedder()
   ```
   *You'll see: "✅ Embedder ready! Tuned for high-performance server."*
   *And possibly: "🔄 Found incomplete session..." if you have saved progress*

2. **Handle any existing session:**
   ```javascript
   checkSession()        // Optional: view saved progress details
   resumeEmbedding()     // If you want to continue previous work (with missing pixel recovery!)
   // OR
   clearSession()        // If you want to start fresh
   ```

3. **Choose location:**
   ```javascript
   embedImage(750, 50, 100)
   ```
   *A file picker will open*

4. **Select your image** (PNG, JPG, JPEG)

5. **Confirm** when prompted about credits

6. **Wait** as it places pixels automatically (progress auto-saved every 10 pixels with missing pixel recovery!)

## 🛠️ All Available Commands

### Core Functions
- `initEmbedder()` - **Always run this first!** (Detects resumable sessions)
- `embedImage(x, y, size)` - Place image, skip pixels that are already correct (saves credits)
- `embedAtCenter(size)` - Place at canvas center (crowded!)

### 🔄 Enhanced Resume Functions (NEW!)
- `checkSession()` - **View saved progress details** (shows original pixel count)
- `resumeEmbedding()` - **Continue with missing pixel recovery** (two modes available)
- `validateImage()` - **Manually check for missing pixels** (works on completed images too)
- `clearSession()` - **Delete saved progress and start fresh**

### 🔥 Canvas War Mode (Overwrites Everything!)
- `embedImageFast(x, y, size)` - **AGGRESSIVE MODE:** Places ALL pixels, overwrites existing art
- `embedAtCenterFast(size)` - Fast mode at center (expect battles!)

**💡 Canvas War Tip:** Use Fast mode to claim territory and overwrite enemy pixels!

### Monitoring & Control
- `showStatus()` - Check progress and current settings (shows resumable session status)
- `stopEmbedding()` - Cancel current placement (progress automatically saved)
- `checkCredits()` - See your current credit balance

---

## 💰 Credit Usage

**Each pixel costs 1 credit.** The script will:
- ✅ Show you the total cost before starting
- ✅ Warn you if you don't have enough credits
- ✅ Skip pixels that are already the correct color (saves credits!)
- ✅ **Save progress automatically** - never lose credits to crashes!
- ✅ **Recover missing pixels** - ensure you get 100% value for your credits!

**Example:** A 60x60 image = up to 3,600 credits (but usually much less after duplicate detection)

---

## 🔍 How Duplicate Detection Works

Before placing pixels, the script checks if they're already the right color:

```
🔍 Checking 2 regions instead of 3,247 individual pixels...
📊 Checking region 1/2...
📊 Checking region 2/2...
✅ Check complete: 1,832 pixels need placement, 1,415 already correct
```

This **saves you credits** and **avoids conflicts** with existing art!

---

## ⚡ Performance & Safety

- **Speed:** 150 pixels per minute (2.5 per second)
- **Burst Protection:** Never exceeds 15 pixels per 10 seconds  
- **Rate Limits:** Mathematically impossible to hit
- **Progress Updates:** Every 50 pixels placed
- **💾 Auto-Save:** Progress saved every 10 pixels (crash protection)
- **🔧 Missing Pixel Recovery:** Validates entire image for completion

**Example output:**
```
🎨 50 placed | 1,782 remaining | 148/min | Credits: 4,250
🎨 100 placed | 1,732 remaining | 151/min | Credits: 4,200
💾 Progress will be saved automatically
🔧 Missing pixel recovery available on resume
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No socket connection found"
- **Solution:** Make sure you're logged into SolGrid first
- Refresh the page and try again

### "Could not detect credits"  
- **Solution:** The script will still work, just watch your credit balance manually

### "Burst limit reached" (shouldn't happen!)
- **Solution:** The script will automatically wait and retry
- This indicates a rare timing issue
- **⚠️ DO NOT modify the delays** - this will cause rate limiting

### Image won't load
- **Solution:** Use PNG, JPG, or JPEG files only
- Make sure the file isn't corrupted

### Rate limiting or account issues
- **Check:** Are you using the official version?
- **Check:** Did someone modify the timing code?
- **Solution:** Re-download the official script

### Lost Progress / Browser Crashed
- **Solution:** Run `initEmbedder()` then `resumeEmbedding()`
- **Choose:** Validation mode for missing pixel recovery
- **Check:** Use `checkSession()` to see saved progress details
- **Note:** Sessions auto-expire after 24 hours

### "No session to resume" 
- **Cause:** No saved progress exists, or session expired (24+ hours old)
- **Solution:** Start a new embedding with `embedImage()` or similar

### Incomplete Images After Network Errors
- **Solution:** Use `resumeEmbedding()` and choose validation mode
- **Alternative:** Use `validateImage()` to check manually
- **Note:** The system now automatically detects and recovers missing pixels!
